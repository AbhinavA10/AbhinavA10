In a side-scrolling world, you are a crab stuck in a room… with only a butterfly. Do you have what it takes to make it across 20 levels? 

When you start the game off, you will be greeted by a menu. You can press ‘s’ or click on the gear to access the settings of the game. You can press ‘c’ to access the credits of Don’t Give Up. 


This is a game like “Give Up”. Don’t Give Up is a side-scrolling platformer in which you are a crab that is trying to make it across to the right side of the room. There are 19 levels, and each level gets progressively harder.
You are allowed to give up a maximum of ten times before the program stops.
You will be bombarded by obstacles such as LaserGuns, spikes, saws, falling platforms, earthquakes, and altered gravity.
