My Personal Website, and some documentation for future use.

I chose to use Bootstrap 4.1 as it helps implement most of the css required to scale my site to mobile. Using the column and grid style formatting makes the website quite reactive.

## Todo and Issues

- [ ] make better favicon.ico/logo
- [ ] -folio template can be used for blog and contact structure-
- [ ] spread chevrons out in carousel
- [ ] carousel caption -- appear too high up on picture, and aren't very readable --> mask?
- [ ] carousel indicators --> change colours
- [ ] update media CSS tags
- [x] add google analytics
- [ ] add poster for all videos
- [ ] movie video source to youtube and iframe. Github Repo too large
- [x] rename PNG, github seems to mix and match
- [ ] To make a button filterable portfolio, use [this](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_elements.asp)
- [ ] For a text-searchable portfolio, use [this](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_filters.asp)
- [ ] use JUSTDOIT as thumbnail for messagewand portfolio instead
- [ ] see if including html files is possible --ex. navbar or footer html
- [ ] update gulp file
- [ ] use JSON insertion to handle past employment?
- [ ] use JSON or html insertion to handle past projects?
- [ ] combine all projects into 1 category -- and can then sort with filterable portfolio for software or hardware.

Notes regarding the above: including html files 
- ssi include directive
- use gulp to create a source and deplor kind directory. we can include files this way
    - build before every commit.
- or use Jquery $().load('header.html') etc. to load html --> cross origin request problem. Look at the reddit link concerning creating local http server

### Planned Sitemap

The following are still left to do:

- [ ] Software
  - [ ] dont give up game
  - [ ] Battlecode
  - [ ] grade 11 libgdx game protoype
  - [ ] twitter Bot
  - [ ] reshape reality window frame game
  - [ ] MachineLearningProjects
